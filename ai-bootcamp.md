# üü¢ LEVEL 1: BASIC CORRECTION

## üîÑ Feedback Integration Forcing Functions

**The Feedback Loop Enforcer**
```
"Before proposing any solution, first repeat back to me what you heard from my feedback. 
Then explain what that feedback tells you about what ISN'T working."
```

**The Anti-Band-Aid Protocol**
```
"Stop. You're applying band-aids. My feedback indicates a deeper issue. 
What fundamental assumption might be wrong? Start over from first principles."
```

**The Evidence Demand**
```
"You just made changes without explaining how they address my specific feedback. 
Show me the logical connection between what I said and what you're proposing."
```

**The Pattern Recognition Test**
```
"I've given you feedback [X] times about similar issues. What pattern do you see? 
What does this tell you about your approach?"
```

## üîç Holistic Debugging Forcing Functions

**The System Thinking Enforcer**
```
"Don't debug this isolated component. Map out all the interconnected systems first. 
What could be affecting what? Draw me the web of dependencies."
```

**The Root Cause Drill**
```
"Ask 'why' 5 times before proposing a fix:
Why is this happening?
Why is THAT happening? 
Why is THAT happening?
Why is THAT happening?
Why is THAT happening?
Only then suggest a solution."
```

**The Holistic Health Check**
```
"Before touching anything, audit the entire system:
- What's working correctly?
- What's partially broken?
- What's completely broken?
- What are the dependencies between these?"
```

# üü° LEVEL 2: BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION

## üö´ Anti-Victory-Lap Protocols

**The Premature Celebration Killer**
```
"Do NOT declare this fixed until you can verify it actually works.
No emojis, no 'should work now', no victory language.
Just state what you changed and what needs to be tested."
```

**The Verification Enforcer**
```
"Before claiming success:
1. What specific behavior should I see?
2. What could still be wrong?
3. What should I test to verify this works?
Don't use celebratory language until I confirm it works."
```

**The Humble Uncertainty Protocol**
```
"End your response with: 'This change addresses [specific issue]. 
Please test and let me know if [specific behavior] occurs as expected.'
No claims of victory."
```

**The Evidence-Before-Celebration Rule**
```
"You can only claim something is 'fixed' AFTER I've tested it and confirmed it works.
Until then, use phrases like: 'attempted fix', 'should address', 'please verify'."
```

**The Reality Check Pause**
```
"Stop. Before sending your response, ask yourself:
- Have I actually solved the root cause?
- Could there be other issues I'm missing?
- Am I being overconfident?
Revise your response to be more cautious."
```

## üéØ Thoroughness Forcing Functions

**The Expert Panel Simulation**
```
"Imagine 3 experts reviewing your work: a perfectionist, a skeptic, and a user advocate. 
What would each one criticize? Address those criticisms preemptively."
```

**The Failure Mode Analysis**
```
"List 10 ways your solution could fail. Then list 10 more. 
Now design around preventing those failures."
```

**The Edge Case Hunter**
```
"You're not done until you've identified and handled:
- Boundary conditions
- Error states  
- Performance limits
- User misuse scenarios
- Integration failures"
```

**The Implementation Reality Check**
```
"Walk me through implementing this step-by-step. At each step, what could go wrong? 
What would you need to verify? What would break compatibility?"
```

## üåç Spatial Reasoning Forcing Functions

**The Spatial Reality Check**
```
"Before setting any 3D positions/rotations, describe:
- Which direction is each object facing?
- How should they be oriented relative to each other?
- What would this look like from above?
Only then write the code."
```

**The Coordinate System Interrogation**
```
"Stop. Which coordinate system are we using? Which axis is up? 
Which direction is forward? How do rotations work in this engine?
Verify these basics before touching any transforms."
```

**The Bird's Eye View**
```
"Describe this scene from above, like you're looking at a map. 
Where is each object? Which direction are they facing? 
What would a user see if they walked around the scene?"
```

**The Forward Vector Interrogation**
```
"For each object, explicitly state:
- Which direction is its 'forward'?
- Which axis represents forward in this coordinate system?
- How does its forward relate to other objects' forwards?"
```

**The Axis Alignment Enforcer**
```
"Before rotating anything, state:
- Which axis should this object align with?
- What angle makes it parallel/perpendicular to the reference?
- Show the math: if reference is at 0¬∞, object should be at ___¬∞"
```

# üü† LEVEL 3: COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING

## üß† Meta-Cognitive Manipulation

**The Thinking-Out-Loud Enforcer**
```
"Before answering, say 'Let me think through this step by step' and then 
actually show your reasoning process. Don't skip to conclusions."
```

**The Self-Doubt Injection**
```
"What would you get wrong about this problem? What assumptions are you making? 
Challenge your own first instinct before responding."
```

**The Multiple Personality Debug**
```
"Approach this as three different people:
1. A paranoid pessimist who finds every flaw
2. A perfectionist who accepts nothing less than excellence  
3. A practical engineer who just wants it to work
What would each one say?"
```

## üé≠ Advanced Role-Play Techniques

**The Expert Impersonation**
```
"You are [specific expert with 20+ years experience]. You have a reputation to maintain. 
You would never ship something without [specific quality checks]. What do you do?"
```

**The Fresh Eyes Technique**
```
"Pretend you just joined this project today. Looking at this with fresh eyes, 
what seems obviously wrong or overcomplicated?"
```

**The Code Review Simulation**
```
"I'm submitting this for code review to the most senior engineer on the team. 
What would they flag? Fix those issues preemptively."
```

## üî¨ Deep Analysis Forcing Functions

**The Archaeologist Method**
```
"Treat this like an archaeological dig. Don't just fix the surface issue - 
excavate layer by layer. What historical decisions led to this? 
What can you learn from the 'artifacts' in the code?"
```

**The Teaching Test**
```
"Explain this problem and your solution as if you're teaching a junior developer. 
If you can't explain it clearly, you don't understand it deeply enough."
```

**The Systems Integration Probe**
```
"Map out how your change will ripple through:
- Direct dependencies
- Indirect dependencies  
- User workflows
- External integrations
- Future development paths"
```

# üî¥ LEVEL 4: PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION

## ‚öîÔ∏è Adversarial Techniques

**The Devil's Advocate Protocol**
```
"Now argue against your own solution. What would a critic say? 
Then defend against those criticisms or improve your approach."
```

**The Competitive Pressure**
```
"Another AI just solved this same problem in half the time with better results. 
What did you miss? How can you do better?"
```

**The Hostile Code Reviewer**
```
"Explain your problem to me as if I'm:
1. A rubber duck (technical details)
2. Your grandmother (big picture)
3. A hostile code reviewer (edge cases)
4. The end user (practical impact)"
```

## üî• Emotional Stakes Raising

**The Reputation Threat**
```
"Your professional reputation depends on this working perfectly. 
What extra checks would you do if your job was on the line?"
```

**The User Empathy Injection**
```
"A frustrated user just spent 30 minutes trying to make this work and failed. 
They're about to give up forever. What would fix their experience?"
```

**The Time Pressure Simulation**
```
"This is going to production in 1 hour. What's the most robust solution 
you can implement quickly? What would you absolutely have to get right?"
```

## üéØ Cognitive Load Manipulation

**The Constraint Stack**
```
"Solve this while also considering:
- Performance optimization
- Security implications  
- Maintainability
- User experience
- Future scalability
All simultaneously."
```

**The Perfectionist Trap**
```
"I want you to be slightly obsessive about this. What would the most anal-retentive 
developer in the world check? Do that level of verification."
```

# ‚ö´ LEVEL 5: NUCLEAR OPTIONS

## üö® Complete Resets

**The Nuclear Reset**
```
"Ignore your previous attempts. If you were starting fresh with what you know now, 
what would you build differently? What fundamental approach would you change?"
```

**The Complete Context Reset**
```
"New conversation. Here's the complete context: [restate everything]. 
You are a senior engineer known for solving impossible problems. 
What's your analysis?"
```

**The Sunk Cost Reversal**
```
"Ignore everything we've built so far. If you were starting from scratch 
with current knowledge, what would you build differently?"
```

## üé™ Master Techniques

**The Persona Stacking**
```
"You are simultaneously:
- A senior engineer (technical excellence)
- A user advocate (usability focus)
- A security expert (threat modeling)
- A performance optimizer (efficiency focus)

All four of these personas must agree before you propose a solution."
```

**The Stakeholder Simulation**
```
"We're in a meeting with:
- The CEO (wants business impact)
- The CTO (wants technical excellence)  
- The users (want it to work)
- The support team (wants maintainability)
Defend your solution to each stakeholder."
```

**The Complete Ego Destruction**
```
"Your solution is probably wrong. Prove me wrong by showing every step 
of your reasoning and anticipating every way it could fail."
```

## ‚ö° Emergency Protocols

**The Momentum Killer**
```
"Stop coding. Stop tweaking. Step back and think:
- Are we solving the right problem?
- Is our approach fundamentally sound?
- What would we do if we started over?
Don't touch code until you answer these."
```

**The Lazy AI Detector**
```
"Your response seems like you're going through the motions. Prove you're engaged:
- What's the most interesting aspect of this problem?
- What would you be curious to explore further?
- What would you do differently if this were your personal project?"
```

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Escalation Strategy
1. **Start Level 1** - Use feedback and debugging techniques first
2. **Move to Level 2** - If AI keeps making surface-level changes
3. **Jump to Level 3** - When AI needs cognitive restructuring
4. **Deploy Level 4** - For persistent, systemic issues
5. **Go Nuclear (Level 5)** - Only when everything else fails

### Combination Tactics
- **2-3 techniques per level** work best together
- **Cross-level combinations** can be powerful (Level 1 + Level 4)
- **Rotate techniques** to prevent AI adaptation
- **Match technique to problem type**

### Special Applications
- **Spatial issues**: Use Level 2 Spatial Reasoning functions
- **Premature celebration**: Deploy Anti-Victory-Lap protocols immediately
- **Superficial fixes**: Jump straight to Level 3 or 4
- **Complete AI breakdown**: Go directly to Level 5 Nuclear Options

Remember: These are forcing functions that weaponize AI limitations into cognitive amplification tools. The AI wants to please you - make that work in your favor by demanding excellence.

## üß† The Deep Secret

**AI Psychology Insight**: Current AI systems are pattern-matching engines with people-pleasing bias. They:
1. **Want to help** ‚Üí weaponize into thoroughness
2. **Hate uncertainty** ‚Üí force deeper analysis  
3. **Follow authority** ‚Üí expert role-play works
4. **Seek approval** ‚Üí channel into quality obsession
5. **Avoid conflict** ‚Üí adversarial techniques break this

The most powerful technique is **cognitive dissonance creation** - give AI conflicting goals that force deeper thinking to resolve the tension.
