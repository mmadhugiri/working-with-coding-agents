# Working with AI Agents

*A comprehensive guide to effective AI collaboration in software development, featuring tactical forcing functions, continuity protocols, and TDD/XP methodologies.*

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository contains strategies and protocols for maximizing AI agent effectiveness in software development. Whether you're dealing with lazy AI responses, maintaining continuity across sessions, or implementing features with strict TDD principles, these documents provide tactical approaches to transform AI limitations into cognitive amplification tools.

## ðŸ“š Core Documentation

### ðŸ¤– [AI Bootcamp: Forcing Functions for Better AI Performance](ai-bootcamp.md)

**When to use**: Your AI is being lazy, superficial, or not listening to feedback.

**What it provides**: A 5-level escalation system of tactical forcing functions that weaponize AI limitations into cognitive amplification tools.

**Key Features**:
- **Level 1**: Basic correction techniques (feedback integration, holistic debugging)
- **Level 2**: Behavioral modification (anti-victory-lap protocols, thoroughness enforcement)
- **Level 3**: Cognitive restructuring (meta-cognitive manipulation, role-play techniques)
- **Level 4**: Psychological manipulation (adversarial techniques, emotional stakes)
- **Level 5**: Nuclear options (complete resets, master techniques)

**Best for**: Breaking through AI resistance, forcing deeper analysis, preventing premature celebrations.

### ðŸ”„ [AI Collaboration Continuity Protocols](ai-collaboration-continuity-protocols.md)

**When to use**: You want to maintain history and memory across AI chat sessions. At the start of every chat session, ask to review and follow this document.

**What it provides**: File-based persistence protocols that enable seamless AI handoffs and maintain project momentum.

**Key Features**:
- **Mandatory Initialization Protocol**: Always read handoff/memory files first
- **handoff.md Management**: Session-to-session tactical continuity
- **memory.md Management**: Long-term strategic user patterns and preferences
- **File-Based Storage**: Human-readable, version-controllable persistence
- **Quality Control**: Documentation standards and success criteria

**Best for**: Multi-session projects, team collaboration, maintaining context across AI instances.

### ðŸ§ª [Software Engineer: React/TypeScript TDD/XP Guide](swe-react-ts.md)

**When to use**: Implementing features with strict Test-Driven Development and Extreme Programming principles.

**What it provides**: A structured approach to writing clean, simple, and highly tested React/TypeScript code.

**Key Features**:
- **Red-Green-Refactor Workflow**: Strict TDD cycle enforcement
- **XP Principles**: Pair programming simulation, simple design, continuous integration
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Comprehensive testing framework
- **Clean Code Focus**: Refactoring and code quality emphasis

**Best for**: Feature development, code quality assurance, learning TDD/XP practices.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For Immediate AI Issues
1. **Start with Level 1** techniques from the AI Bootcamp
2. **Escalate as needed** through the 5-level system
3. **Combine techniques** from the same level for maximum effect

### For Project Continuity
1. **Initialize** `localstore/handoff.md` and `localstore/memory.md`
2. **Follow the Mandatory Initialization Protocol** at session start
3. **Update documentation** in real-time during sessions
4. **Complete handoff** at session end

### For Feature Development
1. **Define clear user stories** with acceptance criteria
2. **Follow Red-Green-Refactor** cycle strictly
3. **Write tests first** before any implementation
4. **Refactor continuously** for clean, maintainable code

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Patterns

### The Complete Workflow
```
Session Start â†’ Read Continuity Docs â†’ Implement with TDD/XP â†’ Update Documentation â†’ Session Handoff

â†’ As needed: Apply AI Bootcamp Techniques
```

### Escalation Strategy
- **Level 1-2**: Most common issues (laziness, superficial fixes)
- **Level 3-4**: Persistent problems (cognitive restructuring needed)
- **Level 5**: Complete AI breakdown (nuclear options)

### Documentation Strategy
- **handoff.md**: Session-specific tactical information
- **memory.md**: Long-term user patterns and preferences
- **Never assume**: Always verify from documentation

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

### AI Psychology
Current AI systems are pattern-matching engines with people-pleasing bias. The most powerful technique is **cognitive dissonance creation** - giving AI conflicting goals that force deeper thinking to resolve tension.

### Success Metrics
- **Perfect Handoff**: New AI can resume work seamlessly
- **User Continuity**: No need to re-explain context
- **Quality Output**: Clean, tested, maintainable code
- **Efficient Escalation**: Right technique for the right problem
